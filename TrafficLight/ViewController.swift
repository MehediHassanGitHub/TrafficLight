 **NOTES:

 This is a very simple app to explain the common colores that are used in a traffic light system.
 
 The app is very simple to use. The user have to tap on the light image to turn on each light and the description will appear accordingly.
 
 
 Possible Enhencement: To make the app more interactive a short quiz would improve the user experience. Also for kids a simple interactive game is suggested where the user can may have a start and stop button to control a moving car through some traffic lights and the user will be awarded if they can stop the car or start the car based on traffic light appears on the screen. This will help a kid to understand the light system.
 

 Refference:
